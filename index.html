        <p> The Coca Cola Freestyle is a machine students dispense beverages and ice from in the dining hall. It solves the problem of too few drink options. 
            This machine gives students the choice of several kinds of Coca-Cola beverages and water. On the left is a picture of the menu screen.</p>

    <div id="User Data" class="container-fluid " background=" white">
        <h2>User Observations</h2> 
        <p> The user approaches the machine and looks for their drink amongst the circular beverage icons on the main menu screen. If users want ice, they generally first press their cup against the ice dispenser to receive ice before selecting a drink. Some users already know exactly what drink they want and are quickly able to find it. Others take some time to look at the options and then select. Once the user clicks on a drink, the screen advances to the screen with their drink of choice. The user then presses their cup against the drink dispenser to receive the drink. They then walk away with their beverage, and the screen automatically returns to the main menu. Some users like to mix more than one drink together, so they use the back button on the screen to select another beverage to add to their drink.
